### Accessing RoboLab Online - MyBinder / BinderHub

You can run the RoboLab environment online using the MyBinder service [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/innovationOUtside/tm129-robotics2020/master).

If you want to save any of the notebooks used there, you will have to download them as follows:

- as a single notebook from the notebook page `File` menu;
- as a zipped archive file of all notebooks using the the download button on the notebook homepage.

You can also upload your own notebooks from the notebook homepage either individually, or as a zip file. If you upload a zip file, you will need to unzip it. You can do this from a notebook command cell using the `unzip` shell command or [using Python code](https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-unzip-a-file-extract-single-multiple-or-all-files-from-a-zip-archive/). More details can be found in the __TO DO?? - see the `RoboLab Environment FAQ`__

#### Persisting Files on MyBinder

The environment launched from MyBinder is ephemeral - it is created on demand when you click a `launch binder` button and is destroyed after a short period of inactivity.

To save your work when working on MyBinder, there are two approaches you can take.

##### Using Notebook Storage

##### Downloading and Uploading Files
