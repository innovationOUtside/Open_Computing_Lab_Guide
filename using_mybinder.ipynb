    "\n",
    "- as a single notebook from the notebook page `File` menu;\n",
    "- as a zipped archive file of all notebooks using the the download button on the notebook homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also upload your own notebooks from the notebook homepage either individually, or as a zip file. If you upload a zip file, you will need to unzip it. You can do this from a notebook command cell using the `unzip` shell command or [using Python code](https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-unzip-a-file-extract-single-multiple-or-all-files-from-a-zip-archive/).
