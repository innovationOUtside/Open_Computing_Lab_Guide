    "*ContainDS* is a cross-platform (MacOS, Windows) desktop application that simplifies the launching and management of Docker containers in general, and Docker containers that incorporate Jupyter notebook servers in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the latest version of Docker. Follow the initial guidance in the `using_docker.md` document to install docker. (You do not need to follow the guidance re: *using* Docker; the ContainDS application provides another way of doing that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the latest version of the ContainDS application directly from the [ContainDS website](https://containds.com/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Windows__ — use *one* of the following:\n",
    "  - [`exe` installer](http://containdsreleases.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/latest/exe)\n",

    "  - __Linux__: *not currently available* __TO DO: Kitematic might be a GUI fall back; or command line, which might make sense anyway.__\n",

    "Alternatively, you may save the installer to your computer by right-clicking the appropriate link and choosing `Save Link As…` or `Save Target As…`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locate the folder containing the downloaded installer: your browser may have a `Downloads` folder, or it may have saved the downloaded file to the `My Documents` or `Desktop` folder. Inside the download folder, find the downloaded installer file and double-click it to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__TO DO - could we get any security warnings?? If so, what, and how do we resolve them??__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you saved the installer earlier, you may now delete it since it is no longer required.\n",

    "The ContainDS application is a desktop application. Run it as you would any other application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: launch the application __TO DO: how??__\n",
    "- MacOS: the application will be installed into your `Applications` folder. You can launch it from there, or add the application icon the Dock to make it easier to find and launch. See also: [MacOS documentation - using the Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35859/mac)."
